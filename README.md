# Solvio

Solvio (read: _quadrant_ ) is a vector similarity search engine.
It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points (vectors with additional payload).

It is tailored on extended support of filtering, which makes it useful for all sorts of neural-network or semantic based matching, faceted search, and other applications. 

Solvio is written in Rust, which makes it reliable even under high load.
