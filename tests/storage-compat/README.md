# Storage compatibility test

In order to detect quickly breakage of storage compatibility, we make sure any PRs results in a system that is still able to read a snapshot of a previous storage folder.

To not burden the git repository with tracking the large binary files, it is using [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/).

## Regenerate storage data

Follow those steps to recreate the reference storage data.

1. start the application `cargo run --bin solvio`
2. run `./tests/storage-compat/gen_storage_compat_data.sh`
3. compare the content of the storage folder with the current `storage.tar.bz2` as a sanity check
4. compress the storage folder using `tar -cjvf storage.tar.bz2 storage/`.
5. replace existing `storage.tar.bz2` with `mv storage.tar.bz2 tests/storage-compat/`
6. run compatibility test with the new archive `./tests/storage-compat/storage-compatibility.sh`
7. Git push LFS changes `git lfs push origin $branch`
8. Git push other changes
